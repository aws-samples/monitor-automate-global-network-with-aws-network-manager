This repository shows an example of an automation solution that can be built taking advantage of [AWS Network Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/tgwnm/what-are-global-networks.html) events. In this folder we provide code for this solution both using Terraform.

## Usage & Deployment

* Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/monitor-automate-global-network-with-aws-network-manager.git
```

* In the *variables.tf* file, update *var.infrastructure_region* and *var.email_address* with the AWS Region you want to build the Transit gateway network, and the email address to receive notifications from the SNS topic.
* Steps to build the environment:
    * `terraform apply` will create the automation solution in **us-west-2**; and the Transit gateway, Transit gateway route table, Global network, and Transit gateway registration in the AWS Region indicated in *var.infrastructure_region*.
    * Change *var.deploy_vpc* to `true` to create the VPC and Transit gateway VPC attachment in the AWS Region indicated in *var.infrastructure_region*. The VPC attachment creation will execute the automation.
* `terraform destroy` will clean-up the resources.
